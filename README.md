## Testing

### Solved Bugs

### Known Bugs

- A warning message is displayed in the console on the live page when testing with Lighthouse. After researching the matter, the error appears to be related to teh fact that GitHub hosted pages disable Google's 3rd party cookie alternative FLoC, which then throws this error. The error doesn't affect the website in any way.
